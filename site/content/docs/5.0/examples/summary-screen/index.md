# Summary Screen
## About
The summary screen is where a user manages an existing campaign and its funding requests. The following users use it
- Marketing/Finance Portal
- Agent-App
- API Sendboxed (e.g., CT, Realtair etc)

It applies to both PND and Classic Clients and will also show "paper" VPAs.

## Responsiveness Requirements
- Users will access this screen across a wide variety of devices. It must look good at every resolution from 320px wide up until 1200px wide. Beyond that, gutters and menus will be used to take up the remaining space.

- A significant portion of users will be accessing this via CampaignTrack, which embeds this screen at 700px wide.
