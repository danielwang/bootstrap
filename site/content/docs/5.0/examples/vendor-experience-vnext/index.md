# Vendor Experience VNext Project
## About
Our products have evolved quickly and do not have a consistent design language. In addition, the "front end" code has also accumulated significant technical debt in the code that controls styling, making it hard/time-consuming to modify.

We aim to fix this throughout the entire product suite. However, we are starting these efforts with a "vertical slice" for the Vendor Experience.

It applies to both PND and Classic Clients and will also show "paper" VPAs.
